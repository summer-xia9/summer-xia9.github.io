abstract: Abstract The development of lithium–sulfur batteries is impeded by their
  suboptimal electrochemical performance and significant self-discharge under practical
  conditions, especially at high sulfur-to-host ratios and low electrolyte-to-sulfur
  ratios. Under these conditions, improving electrochemical performance necessitates
  accelerating the polysulfides conversion, while reducing self-discharge entails
  inhibiting the same conversion (disproportionation reaction, a key contributor to
  self-discharge). Herein, to address this challenging contradiction, an imprisoning
  strategy is designed that utilizes programmable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
  layers formed only on the outer surface of TiO2−x coated hollow carbon spheres (TiO2−x@C).
  TiO2−x@C is chosen primarily because that it supports regulated SEI growth upon
  simple voltage control, leveraging the different SEI formation potential on TiO2−x
  and C, and its conductivity and catalytic property ensure high sulfur reaction kinetics.
  This strategy functions effectively even under practical conditions. The exposed
  internal surface provides abundant effective sites and the outer SEI (as a dense
  barrier) prevents polysulfides from migrating out of spheres, improving the electrochemical
  performance. These soluble polysulfides, being confined within spheres, easily reach
  saturation concentrations during storage, inhibiting disproportionation reaction.
  Consequently, SEI wrapped TiO2−x@C/sulfur cathodes exhibit both high electrochemical
  performance and low self-discharge. This work is a new attempt to achieve above
  simultaneous optimization without performance compromise.
