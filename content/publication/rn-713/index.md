abstract: Oxygen vacancies are usually considered to be beneficial in catalytic conversion
  of polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries. Now it is demonstrated that the conversion
  of polysulfides was hindered by oxygen vacancies on ultrathin niobic acid. The inferior
  performance induced by the oxygen vacancy was mainly attributed to the decreased
  electric conductivity as well as the weakened adsorption of polysulfides on the
  catalyst surface. This work shows that the care should be taken when designing a
  new catalyst for the lithium-sulfur battery using a defect-engineering strategy.
