abstract: Abstract A carbon thin film/carbon foam core/sheath structure was synthesized
  by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on carbonized melamine foam. It has a specific
  capacitance of 310 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and shows outstanding electrochemical
  performance in both aqueous and water-in-salt electrolytes. Electrochemical analysis
  by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge testing revealed a large
  capacitive contribution up to more than 90 % of its total capacitance. The core/sheath
  structure has advantages in ion transport and a high degree of utilization of the
  electrode surface, and the synthetic process provides a way to coat carbon thin
  film on any substrate by nickel-catalyzed CVD.
