abstract: Porous nanomaterials have great potential in biomedical applications due
  to their unique structure and properties. Herein, we demonstrated the synthesis
  of porous gadolinium oxide nanosheets (Gd2O3 NSs) with a colloidal synthesis method.
  The porous Gd2O3 NSs exhibited a promising pH-responsive drug release behavior for
  cancer chemotherapy and can be used as an efficient contrast agent for magnetic
  resonance (MR) imaging.
