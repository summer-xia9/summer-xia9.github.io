 abstract = {Porous nanomaterials have great potential in biomedical applications due to their unique structure and properties. Herein, we demonstrated the synthesis of porous gadolinium oxide nanosheets (Gd2O3 NSs) with a colloidal synthesis method. The porous Gd2O3 NSs exhibited a promising pH-responsive drug release behavior for cancer chemotherapy and can be used as an efficient contrast agent for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.},
