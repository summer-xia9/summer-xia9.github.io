abstract: Abstract Composite sulfide electrolytes (CSEs), composed of a sulfide electrolyte
  matrix and a small amount of polymer binder, are promising for all-solid-state lithium
  batteries (ASSLBs) owing to their potential to achieve both high ionic conductivity
  and mechanical robustness. However, current polymer-based binders are not well ionically
  conductive and generally have non-/low-polarity, leading to a dramatic decrease
  in ionic conductivity and weak interparticle bonding; furthermore, CSEs are still
  unstable in air. Herein, a unique polymer-in-salt binder is proposed, further engineered
  with an ion-conducting hydrophobic layer (IHL) on surface to design hydrophobic
  CSE (HCSE) to address the above challenges. Specifically, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)
  (PVDF-HFP)-based polymer-in-salt binder is introduced into Li6PS5Cl to bridge interparticle
  ion transport via facile wet process, constructing a continuous fast-ion transport
  network and achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10−3 S cm−1; while the F-containing
  groups in PVDF-HFP provide strong bonding, enabling good mechanical properties with
  a film thickness of only 57 µm. Besides, IHL with low surface energy ensures HCSE
  to remain air-stable. The LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li-In full cell delivers high capacity
  and remains stable over 100 cycles, while corresponding pouch cell with no extra
  pressure shows excellent operation safety and reliability. This work presents a
  new avenue for developing high-performing CSE-based ASSLBs.
