abstract: All-solid-state lithium-metal batteries (ASSLBs) have attracted intense
  interest due to their high energy density and high safety. However, Li dendrite
  growth and high interface resistance remain challenging due to insufficient understanding
  of the mechanism. Here we develop two types of porous lithiophobic interlayer (Li7N2I–carbon
  nanotube and Li7N2I–Mg) to enable Li to plate at the Li/interlayer interface and
  reversibly penetrate into the porous interlayer. The experimental and simulation
  results reveal that a balance of lithiophobicity, electronic and ionic conductivities
  and interlayer’s porosity are the key enablers for stable Li plating/stripping at
  a high capacity. A fine-tuned Li7N2I–carbon nanotube interlayer enables Li/LNI/Li
  symmetric cell to achieve a high critical current density of 4.0 mA cm−2 at 4.0 mAh cm−2
  at 25 °C; the Li7N2I–Mg interlayer enables a Li4SiO4@LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li6PS5Cl/20 µm-Li
  full cell to achieve an areal capacity of 2.2 mAh cm−2, maintaining 82.4% capacity
  retention after 350 cycles at 60 °C at a rate of 0.5 C. The interlayer design principle
  opens opportunities to develop safe and high energy ASSLBs.
