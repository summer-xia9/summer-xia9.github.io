abstract: Sulfide solid electrolytes with an ultrahigh ionic conductivity are considered
  to be extremely promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes for next-generation
  lithium batteries. However, it is difficult to obtain a thin solid electrolyte layer
  with good mechanical properties due to the weak binding ability between their powder
  particles, which seriously limits the actual energy density of sulfide all-solid-state
  lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Fortunately, the preparation of sulfide-polymer composite
  solid electrolyte (SPCSE) membranes by introducing polymer effectively reduces the
  thickness of solid electrolytes and guarantees high mechanical properties. In this
  review, recent progress of SPCSE membranes for ASSLBs is summarized. The classification
  of components in SPCSE membranes is first introduced briefly. Then, the preparation
  methods of SPCSE membranes are categorized according to process characteristics,
  in which the challenges of different methods and their corresponding solutions are
  carefully reviewed. The energy densities of the full battery composed of SPCSE membranes
  are further given whenever available to help understanding the device-level performance.
  Finally, we discuss the potential challenges and research opportunities for SPCSE
  membranes to guide the future development of high-performance sulfide ASSLBs.
