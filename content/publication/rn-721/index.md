abstract: Abstract Copper fluoride (CuF2) has the highest energy density among all
  metal fluoride cathodes owing to its high theoretical potential (3.55 V) and high
  capacity (528 mAh g−1). However, CuF2 can only survive for less than five cycles,
  mainly due to serious Cu-ion dissolution during charge/discharge cycles. Herein,
  copper dissolution is successfully suppressed by forming Cu2+-coordinated sodium
  alginate (Cu-SA) on the surface of CuF2 particles during the electrode fabrication
  process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder.
  The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2 can in situ cross-link with SA binder
  forming a conformal Cu-SA layer on CuF2 surface. After water evaporation during
  the electrode dry process, the Cu-SA layer is Li-ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator,
  which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu-ions in the organic 4 m LiClO4/ethylene
  carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2.
  CuF2 electrode with SA binder delivers a reversible capacity of 420.4 mAh g-1 after
  50 cycles at 0.05 C, reaching an energy density of 1009.1 Wh kg-1. Cu2+ cross-link
  polymer coating on CuF2 opens the door for stabilizing the high-energy and low-cost
  CuF2 cathode for next-generation Li-ion batteries.
