 abstract = {2D nanomaterials generally exhibit enhanced physiochemical and biological functions in biomedical applications due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and surface charge. Conventional cancer chemotherapy based on nanomaterials has been hindered by their low drug loading and poor penetration in tumor tissue. To overcome these difficulties, novel materials systems are urgently needed. Hereby, the lanthanide-based porphyrin metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (NSs) with promising cancer imaging/chemotherapy capacities are fabricated, which display superior performance in the drug loading and tumor tissue penetration. The biodegradable PPF-Gd NSs deliver an ultrahigh drug loading (>1500%) and demonstrate the stable and highly sensitive stimuli-responsive degradation/release for multimodal tumor imaging and cancer chemotherapy. Meanwhile, PPF-Gd NSs also exhibit excellent fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging capability in vitro and in vivo. Compared to the traditional doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, the in vivo results confirm the evident suppression of the tumor growth by the PPF-Gd/DOX drug delivery system with negligible side effects. This work further supports the potential of lanthanide-based MOF nanomaterials as biodegradable systems to promote the cancer theranostics technology development in the future.},
