abstract: 2D nanomaterials generally exhibit enhanced physiochemical and biological
  functions in biomedical applications due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and
  surface charge. Conventional cancer chemotherapy based on nanomaterials has been
  hindered by their low drug loading and poor penetration in tumor tissue. To overcome
  these difficulties, novel materials systems are urgently needed. Hereby, the lanthanide-based
  porphyrin metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (NSs) with promising cancer imaging/chemotherapy
  capacities are fabricated, which display superior performance in the drug loading
  and tumor tissue penetration. The biodegradable PPF-Gd NSs deliver an ultrahigh
  drug loading (>1500%) and demonstrate the stable and highly sensitive stimuli-responsive
  degradation/release for multimodal tumor imaging and cancer chemotherapy. Meanwhile,
  PPF-Gd NSs also exhibit excellent fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging capability
  in vitro and in vivo. Compared to the traditional doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy,
  the in vivo results confirm the evident suppression of the tumor growth by the PPF-Gd/DOX
  drug delivery system with negligible side effects. This work further supports the
  potential of lanthanide-based MOF nanomaterials as biodegradable systems to promote
  the cancer theranostics technology development in the future.
