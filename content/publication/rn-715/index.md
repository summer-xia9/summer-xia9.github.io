abstract: Abstract LiNixCoyMnzO2 (x+y+z=1)||graphite lithium-ion battery (LIB) chemistry
  promises practical applications. However, its low-temperature (≤ −20 °C) performance
  is poor because the increased resistance encountered by Li+ transport in and across
  the bulk electrolytes and the electrolyte/electrode interphases induces capacity
  loss and battery failures. Though tremendous efforts have been made, there is still
  no effective way to reduce the charge transfer resistance (Rct) which dominates
  low-temperature LIBs performance. Herein, we propose a strategy of using low-polarity-solvent
  electrolytes which have weak interactions between the solvents and the Li+ to reduce
  Rct, achieving facile Li+ transport at sub-zero temperatures. The exemplary electrolyte
  enables LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||graphite cells to deliver a capacity of ≈113 mAh g−1
  (98 % full-cell capacity) at 25 °C and to remain 82 % of their room-temperature
  capacity at −20 °C without lithium plating at 1/3C. They also retain 84 % of their
  capacity at −30 °C and 78 % of their capacity at −40 °C and show stable cycling
  at 50 °C.
