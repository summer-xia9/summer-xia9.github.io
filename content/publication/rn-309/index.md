abstract: Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrodes
  for supercapacitors due to their adjustable composition, designable function and
  superior high theoretic capacity. However, their experimental specific capacity
  is significantly lower than the theoretical value due to their small interlayer
  spacing. Therefore, obtaining large interlayer spacing through the intercalation
  of large-sized anions is an important means to improve capacity performance. Herein,
  a metal organic framework derived cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide hollowcage
  intercalated with different concentrations of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2 BDC)
  through in-situ cationic etching and organic ligand intercalation method is designed
  and fabricated. The superior specific capacity and excellent rate performance are
  benefit from the large specific surface area of the hollow structure and increasing
  interlayer spacing of LDH after H2 BDC intercalation. The sample with the largest
  layer spacing displays a maximum specific capacity of 229 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)
  . In addition, the hybrid supercapacitor assembled from the sample with the largest
  layer spacing and active carbon electrode has a maximum specific capacity of 158
  mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) ; the energy density is as high as 126.4 W h kg(-1) at 800
  W kg(-1) and good cycle stability.
