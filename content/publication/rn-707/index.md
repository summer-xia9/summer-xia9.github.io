abstract: 'Solid polymers are promising electrolytes for Li-metal batteries, but they
  have limitations: they cannot simultaneously achieve high ionic conductivity, good
  mechanical strength and compatibility with high-voltage cathodes while suppressing
  Li dendrites. Here, we design a class of locally high-concentration solid polymer
  electrolytes based on polymer blends, which are termed Li-polymer in F diluter (LPIFD).
  The Li-polymer (polymer-in-salt) ensures continuous Li-ion conduction channels and
  contributes to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the F diluter (inert
  fluorinated polymer) adds mechanical strength. Studies reveal that a single-phase
  LPIFD, which is based on a miscible polymer blend, lacks phase boundaries and forms
  an organic-less and LiF-rich SEI, effectively suppressing lithium dendrites. The
  single-phase LPIFD delivers ionic conductivity of 3.0 × 10−4 S cm−1, and enables
  the Li anode to reach a high coulombic efficiency of 99.1% and a critical current
  density of 3.7 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the ability to form an F-rich cathode electrolyte
  interphase allows LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cells to achieve a cycle life of 450 cycles
  at a high operating voltage of 4.5 V. This design will inspire efforts to commercialize
  polymer electrolytes for high-energy Li-metal batteries.'
