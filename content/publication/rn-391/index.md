abstract: Abstract Organic compounds with electroactive sites are considered as a
  new generation of green electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. However,
  exploring effective approaches to design high-capacity molecules and suppressing
  their solubilization remain big challenges. Herein, a functional anode architecture
  is first designed by using chemical bonds between organic compound and rare earth
  hollow structure, which enables active materials to be efficiently utilized, accelerates
  reaction kinetics, and mitigates undesired dissolution in electrolyte. Compared
  with pure organic sodium naphthyl-based tetrathiocarboxylate (SNBT) compound and
  CeO2@Carbon, the hybrid electrode (CeO2@Carbon/SNBT) exhibits the best long-term
  cyclability and its capacity retention has significantly increased. The current
  strategy would trigger more investigations into the development of organic materials
  for commercialized applications.
