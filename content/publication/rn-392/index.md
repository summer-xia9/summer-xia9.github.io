abstract: Three-dimensionally (3-D) hierarchical BiOBr microspheres have been successfully
  synthesized using a facile and efficient solvothermal method in the reaction system
  consisting of Bi(NO3)35H2O and KBr as well as ethylene glycol (EG). The characterized
  results showed that all BiOBr microspheres consisted of pure tetragonal BiOBr phase
  with good crystallinity. The photocatalytic property of 3-D BiOBr microspheres was
  investigated by the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation,
  the reaction results revealed that the as-prepared microspheres exhibited excellent
  visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity. Recycling test experiments indicated
  that the BiOBr microspheres had higher stability and recyclability.
