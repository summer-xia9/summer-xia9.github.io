abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanomaterials have shown extensive attention
  and potential biomedical applications in cancer theranostics. Herein, for the first
  time, we report the synthesis of monodisperse ultrathin lanthanum oxyiodide (LaOI)
  nanosheets with a thickness of merely 3 nm based on a facile wet chemistry strategy.
  By tuning the solvent composition and molar ratios of the precursors, we can modulate
  the shape and thickness of the nanosheets. Furthermore, a series of ultrathin lanthanide
  oxyiodides are synthesized by this method with tunable morphology. LaOI nanosheets
  as drug delivery platform showed ultrahigh anticancer doxorubicin (DOX) loading
  capacity (300 wt%) and pH-responsive release behaviour, as well as excellent cellular
  biocompatibility and efficiently intracellular nucleus delivery of DOX. LaOI with
  low dose DOX demonstrate enhanced cancer cell killing ability in vitro compared
  with DOX. The intravenous melanoma model shows that LaOI with low dose (1 mg mL−1)
  could significantly inhibit the tumor growth without side toxicity, relative to
  pure DOX. In addition, LaOI nanosheets also act as high resolution contrast agent
  for enhanced X-ray computed tomography imaging relative to the commercial iohexol.
  In summary, the LaOI nanosheets could serve as a competitive safe and low dose drug
  delivery platform for highly efficiently cancer imaging and therapy.
