   abstract = {Sulfide solid electrolytes with an ultrahigh ionic conductivity are considered to be extremely promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes for next-generation lithium batteries. However, it is difficult to obtain a thin solid electrolyte layer with good mechanical properties due to the weak binding ability between their powder particles, which seriously limits the actual energy density of sulfide all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Fortunately, the preparation of sulfide-polymer composite solid electrolyte (SPCSE) membranes by introducing polymer effectively reduces the thickness of solid electrolytes and guarantees high mechanical properties. In this review, recent progress of SPCSE membranes for ASSLBs is summarized. The classification of components in SPCSE membranes is first introduced briefly. Then, the preparation methods of SPCSE membranes are categorized according to process characteristics, in which the challenges of different methods and their corresponding solutions are carefully reviewed. The energy densities of the full battery composed of SPCSE membranes are further given whenever available to help understanding the device-level performance. Finally, we discuss the potential challenges and research opportunities for SPCSE membranes to guide the future development of high-performance sulfide ASSLBs.},

   abstract = {Abstract The development of lithium–sulfur batteries is impeded by their suboptimal electrochemical performance and significant self-discharge under practical conditions, especially at high sulfur-to-host ratios and low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratios. Under these conditions, improving electrochemical performance necessitates accelerating the polysulfides conversion, while reducing self-discharge entails inhibiting the same conversion (disproportionation reaction, a key contributor to self-discharge). Herein, to address this challenging contradiction, an imprisoning strategy is designed that utilizes programmable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers formed only on the outer surface of TiO2−x coated hollow carbon spheres (TiO2−x@C). TiO2−x@C is chosen primarily because that it supports regulated SEI growth upon simple voltage control, leveraging the different SEI formation potential on TiO2−x and C, and its conductivity and catalytic property ensure high sulfur reaction kinetics. This strategy functions effectively even under practical conditions. The exposed internal surface provides abundant effective sites and the outer SEI (as a dense barrier) prevents polysulfides from migrating out of spheres, improving the electrochemical performance. These soluble polysulfides, being confined within spheres, easily reach saturation concentrations during storage, inhibiting disproportionation reaction. Consequently, SEI wrapped TiO2−x@C/sulfur cathodes exhibit both high electrochemical performance and low self-discharge. This work is a new attempt to achieve above simultaneous optimization without performance compromise.},

Here, using a noninterference KTiOPO4 thin-film model, the Na+ storage mechanism is comprehensively revealed by in situ/operando spectroscopy, aberration-corrected electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. We find that incomplete K+/Na+ ion exchange occurs and eventually 0.15 K+ remains as a pillar to stabilize the tunnel structure. The pillar effect substantially maintains the volume change within 3.9%, much smaller than that of K+(Na+) insertion into KTiOPO4(NaTiOPO4) (9.5%; 5%), thus enabling 10,000 cycles. The powder electrode demonstrates comparable capacity and can work efficiently at commercial-level areal capacity of 2.47 mAh cm−2. The quasi-solid-state pouch cell with high safety under extreme abuse also manifests long-term cycling stability. This pillar chemistry will inspire alkali metal ion storage in hosts containing heterogeneous cations.},

   abstract = {Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrodes for supercapacitors due to their adjustable composition, designable function and superior high theoretic capacity. However, their experimental specific capacity is significantly lower than the theoretical value due to their small interlayer spacing. Therefore, obtaining large interlayer spacing through the intercalation of large-sized anions is an important means to improve capacity performance. Herein, a metal organic framework derived cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide hollowcage intercalated with different concentrations of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2 BDC) through in-situ cationic etching and organic ligand intercalation method is designed and fabricated. The superior specific capacity and excellent rate performance are benefit from the large specific surface area of the hollow structure and increasing interlayer spacing of LDH after H2 BDC intercalation. The sample with the largest layer spacing displays a maximum specific capacity of 229 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) . In addition, the hybrid supercapacitor assembled from the sample with the largest layer spacing and active carbon electrode has a maximum specific capacity of 158 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) ; the energy density is as high as 126.4 W h kg(-1) at 800 W kg(-1) and good cycle stability.},

Though tremendous efforts have been made, there is still no effective way to reduce the charge transfer resistance (Rct) which dominates low-temperature LIBs performance. Herein, we propose a strategy of using low-polarity-solvent electrolytes which have weak interactions between the solvents and the Li+ to reduce Rct, achieving facile Li+ transport at sub-zero temperatures. The exemplary electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||graphite cells to deliver a capacity of ≈113 mAh g−1 (98 % full-cell capacity) at 25 °C and to remain 82 % of their room-temperature capacity at −20 °C without lithium plating at 1/3C. They also retain 84 % of their capacity at −30 °C and 78 % of their capacity at −40 °C and show stable cycling at 50 °C.},

Here we develop two types of porous lithiophobic interlayer (Li7N2I–carbon nanotube and Li7N2I–Mg) to enable Li to plate at the Li/interlayer interface and reversibly penetrate into the porous interlayer. The experimental and simulation results reveal that a balance of lithiophobicity, electronic and ionic conductivities and interlayer’s porosity are the key enablers for stable Li plating/stripping at a high capacity. A fine-tuned Li7N2I–carbon nanotube interlayer enables Li/LNI/Li symmetric cell to achieve a high critical current density of 4.0 mA cm−2 at 4.0 mAh cm−2 at 25 °C; the Li7N2I–Mg interlayer enables a Li4SiO4@LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li6PS5Cl/20 µm-Li full cell to achieve an areal capacity of 2.2 mAh cm−2, maintaining 82.4% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 60 °C at a rate of 0.5 C.

However, CuF2 can only survive for less than five cycles, mainly due to serious Cu-ion dissolution during charge/discharge cycles. Herein, copper dissolution is successfully suppressed by forming Cu2+-coordinated sodium alginate (Cu-SA) on the surface of CuF2 particles during the electrode fabrication process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder. The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2 can in situ cross-link with SA binder forming a conformal Cu-SA layer on CuF2 surface. After water evaporation during the electrode dry process, the Cu-SA layer is Li-ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu-ions in the organic 4 m LiClO4/ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2. CuF2 electrode with SA binder delivers a reversible capacity of 420.4 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.05 C, reaching an energy density of 1009.1 Wh kg-1.

Meanwhile, PPF-Gd NSs also exhibit excellent fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging capability in vitro and in vivo. Compared to the traditional doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, the in vivo results confirm the evident suppression of the tumor growth by the PPF-Gd/DOX drug delivery system with negligible side effects. This work further supports the potential of lanthanide-based MOF nanomaterials as biodegradable systems to promote the cancer theranostics technology development in the future.},

By tuning the solvent composition and molar ratios of the precursors, we can modulate the shape and thickness of the nanosheets. Furthermore, a series of ultrathin lanthanide oxyiodides are synthesized by this method with tunable morphology. LaOI nanosheets as drug delivery platform showed ultrahigh anticancer doxorubicin (DOX) loading capacity (300 wt%) and pH-responsive release behaviour, as well as excellent cellular biocompatibility and efficiently intracellular nucleus delivery of DOX. LaOI with low dose DOX demonstrate enhanced cancer cell killing ability in vitro compared with DOX. The intravenous melanoma model shows that LaOI with low dose (1 mg mL−1) could significantly inhibit the tumor growth without side toxicity, relative to pure DOX. In addition, LaOI nanosheets also act as high resolution contrast agent for enhanced X-ray computed tomography imaging relative to the commercial iohexol. In summary, the LaOI nanosheets could serve as a competitive safe and low dose drug delivery platform for highly efficiently cancer imaging and therapy.},

It has a specific capacitance of 310 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and shows outstanding electrochemical performance in both aqueous and water-in-salt electrolytes. Electrochemical analysis by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge testing revealed a large capacitive contribution up to more than 90 % of its total capacitance. The core/sheath structure has advantages in ion transport and a high degree of utilization of the electrode surface, and the synthetic process provides a way to coat carbon thin film on any substrate by nickel-catalyzed CVD.},

   abstract = {Oxygen vacancies are usually considered to be beneficial in catalytic conversion of polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries. Now it is demonstrated that the conversion of polysulfides was hindered by oxygen vacancies on ultrathin niobic acid. The inferior performance induced by the oxygen vacancy was mainly attributed to the decreased electric conductivity as well as the weakened adsorption of polysulfides on the catalyst surface. This work shows that the care should be taken when designing a new catalyst for the lithium-sulfur battery using a defect-engineering strategy.},

   abstract = {Abstract Composite sulfide electrolytes (CSEs), composed of a sulfide electrolyte matrix and a small amount of polymer binder, are promising for all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) owing to their potential to achieve both high ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness. However, current polymer-based binders are not well ionically conductive and generally have non-/low-polarity, leading to a dramatic decrease in ionic conductivity and weak interparticle bonding; furthermore, CSEs are still unstable in air. Herein, a unique polymer-in-salt binder is proposed, further engineered with an ion-conducting hydrophobic layer (IHL) on surface to design hydrophobic CSE (HCSE) to address the above challenges. Specifically, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)-based polymer-in-salt binder is introduced into Li6PS5Cl to bridge interparticle ion transport via facile wet process, constructing a continuous fast-ion transport network and achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10−3 S cm−1; while the F-containing groups in PVDF-HFP provide strong bonding, enabling good mechanical properties with a film thickness of only 57 µm. Besides, IHL with low surface energy ensures HCSE to remain air-stable. The LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li-In full cell delivers high capacity and remains stable over 100 cycles, while corresponding pouch cell with no extra pressure shows excellent operation safety and reliability. This work presents a new avenue for developing high-performing CSE-based ASSLBs.},

   abstract = {Solid polymers are promising electrolytes for Li-metal batteries, but they have limitations: they cannot simultaneously achieve high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength and compatibility with high-voltage cathodes while suppressing Li dendrites. Here, we design a class of locally high-concentration solid polymer electrolytes based on polymer blends, which are termed Li-polymer in F diluter (LPIFD). The Li-polymer (polymer-in-salt) ensures continuous Li-ion conduction channels and contributes to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the F diluter (inert fluorinated polymer) adds mechanical strength. Studies reveal that a single-phase LPIFD, which is based on a miscible polymer blend, lacks phase boundaries and forms an organic-less and LiF-rich SEI, effectively suppressing lithium dendrites. The single-phase LPIFD delivers ionic conductivity of 3.0 × 10−4 S cm−1, and enables the Li anode to reach a high coulombic efficiency of 99.1% and a critical current density of 3.7 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the ability to form an F-rich cathode electrolyte interphase allows LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cells to achieve a cycle life of 450 cycles at a high operating voltage of 4.5 V. This design will inspire efforts to commercialize polymer electrolytes for high-energy Li-metal batteries.},
